### Language Workshop 🛠️

A personal hub for practicing programming exercises from books across multiple languages.
This is my multi-language “workshop” where I experiment, practice, and track coding exercises.

**Purpose:**  
- Keep exercises organized by language.
- Track progress from different programming books.  
- Provide a clear structure for revisiting and practicing later.

**How to Use This Repo:**
- Browse the folders below to see exercises by language.  
- Each folder contains exercises from one or more books in that language.  
> Feel free to clone, study, and experiment with the exercises yourself.
