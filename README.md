### 🛠️ Language Workshop

A personal hub for practicing programming exercises from books across multiple languages.
This is my multi-language “workshop” where I experiment, practice, and track coding exercises.

**Purpose:**  
- Keep exercises organized by language.
- Track progress from different programming books.  
- Provide a clear structure for revisiting and practicing later.
